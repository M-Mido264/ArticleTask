1)-Divided the structure of the app.
2)-builed models using code first.
3)-builed user authentication usnig identity.
4)-building apis with make controllers and resources.(used auto mapper to map between models and resources)
5)-used repository pattern to add and remove articles
6)-used unit of work pattern to save data changes in database.
7)-test apis using postman.
8)-start building angular project.
9)-build services in angular project to link apis with front end.
10)-builed component and design the frontend using bootstrap.

Notes:
i made login for admin only so when you test the app use register api in postman to register account for admin to use it in the app.
i authorize to add and remove functions so only admin can use and access this functions.
